# Assignment 2

### 1. What is NPM?
1.  It is used to install, share, and manage JavaScript packages, which are bundles of code that can be used to perform specific tasks. 
2. npm doesn't mean node package manager but everything Else.

### 2. What is 'Parcel/Webpack'? Why do we need it?
1. Webpack / parcels are bundlers.

2. In any framework, to get external functionalities we use bundlers. It packages your app properly so it can be shipped to production.

### 3. What is '.parcel-cache'?
1. '.parcel-cache' is a directory generated by the Parcel bundler, serving as a cache for storing intermediate build results. It enhances the development workflow by speeding up subsequent builds and optimizing resource usage. 

2. In summary, '.parcel-cache' plays a crucial role in streamlining the development workflow by minimizing build times and enhancing resource utilization, making it an essential component of Parcel's bundling process.

3. Example: suppose you're building a web app with hundreds of components and a vast network of dependencies. Every time you modify a single component, Parcel would typically need to recompile all related files and dependencies. However, with the '.parcel-cache' in place, Parcel can simply utilize the cached versions of these unchanged files, expediting the compilation process.

### 4. What is 'npx'?
1. npx stands for Node Package eXecute. 

2. It means execute using npm.

3. Example: suppose you're building a web app with hundreds of components and a vast network of dependencies. Every time you modify a single component, Parcel would typically need to recompile all related files and dependencies. However, with the '.parcel-cache' in place, Parcel can simply utilize the cached versions of these unchanged files, expediting the compilation process.

### 5. What is difference between 'dependencies' vs 'Devdependencies'?

1. Dependencies: These are packages that are required for the application to run in production. They are installed when the application is deployed to a web server or other production environment.

2. DevDependencies: These are packages that are only needed for development purposes, such as testing, linting, and building the application. They are not required for the application to run in production and are not installed when the application is deployed.. 

3. So, in summary, dependencies are required for the application to run in production, while devDependencies are only needed for development purposes.

### 6. What is Tree Shaking?
1. TTree shaking is a technique used by JavaScript bundlers to remove unused code from an application's bundle. This can significantly reduce the size of the bundle, which can improve loading times and performance

2. Tree shaking works by analyzing the dependency graph of the application's code. 

3. Example: Imagine you are developing a web application that uses a large UI library, such as Material UI. Material UI includes a lot of components, but you may only be using a few of them in your application. Tree shaking can be used to remove the unused components from the bundle, which can reduce the size of the bundle by a significant amount.


### 7. What is Hot Module Replacement (HMR)?
1. Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a powerful development tool that enables real-time updates to modules in a running application without requiring a full page reload. This significantly accelerates the development process by eliminating the need for constant restarting and refreshing, providing a seamless and efficient coding experience.

### 8. List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 4 of them in your own words?
1. 5 Favourite superpowers of parcel:
    -   Zero Configuration
    -   Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
    -   Image Optimization
    -   Cosistency Hashing Algorithm
    -   File Watcher Algorithm

2. Zero Configuration: Imagine a world where you don't need to spend hours configuring build tools or chasing down compatibility issues. That's the beauty of Parcel's zero-configuration approach. It simply works, allowing you to focus on writing code, not configuring tools.

3. Image Optimization: Parcel optimizes images for web delivery, reducing file sizes and improving loading times. It utilizes various techniques, such as compression, resizing, and format conversion.

4. Consistency Hashing Algorithm: Parcel employs a consistency hashing algorithm to ensure consistent caching of assets across different builds. This helps maintain a consistent user experience and reduces unnecessary asset downloads.

5. File Watcher Algorithm: Parcel's file watcher algorithm efficiently monitors changes in project files and triggers recompilation only when necessary. This streamlines the development process and avoids unnecessary recompilations.
### 9. What is '.gitignore'? What should we add and not add into it?

1. A '.gitignore' file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project. 

2. This is useful for preventing Git from tracking and committing files that you don't want to include in the repository.

3. Anything which can be regenerated should be put inside .gitignore.


### 10. What is the difference between 'package.json' and 'package-lock.json'?
1. 'package.json' and 'package-lock.json' are both JSON files that are used to manage packages for JavaScript projects. However, they serve different purposes:

2. package.json: 
    -   A manifest file that describes the project and its dependencies.
    -   Specifies the desired versions of dependencies. 
    -   Used for installing, sharing, and managing dependencies
 
3. package-lock.json: 
    -   A lockfile that records the exact versions of installed dependencies. 
    -   Ensures deterministic installations by locking the exact versions of dependencies and their dependencies. 
    -   Prevents unexpected changes in dependencies when running npm install.

### 11. Why should I not modify 'package-lock.json'?
1. Don't modify 'package-lock.json' manually. It is automatically generated by npm and contains a precise record of the exact versions of dependencies and their dependencies that are installed in your project.

2. Modifying it directly can lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior across development environments.

### 12. What is 'node_modules'? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
1. The 'node_modules' folder contains the third-party dependencies your Node.js project relies on. 

2. Pushing 'node_modules' to Git is not recommended due to its large size, version control redundancy, and dependency management inefficiency

3. Instead, 'node_modules' should be added to the project's '.gitignore' file to prevent it from being tracked or uploaded to the repository.

### 13. What is the 'dist' folder?
1. In web development, the 'dist' folder, short for 'distribution,' serves as a repository for the compiled and optimized output of a web application. It typically contains the JavaScript, CSS, and other web-related files that are ready to be deployed to a production server.

2. Consider building a web app with the React JavaScript library. The 'dist' folder would hold the minified and bundled versions of your React components, along with any required third-party libraries and optimized assets. This final output is what serves as the foundation for delivering your web app to users.

3. The 'dist' folder plays a crucial role in streamlining the deployment process by providing a ready-to-deploy collection of web application files. It ensures that the optimized and packaged code is efficiently delivered to users, enhancing the performance and loading speed of the web app.
### 14. What is the 'browserslist'? Read about diff. bundlers: vite, webpack, parcel
1. In web development, 'browserslist' is a configuration file that specifies the browsers and their versions that your web application should support. 

2. It plays a crucial role in ensuring browser compatibility by guiding CSS preprocessors and JavaScript bundlers to generate code that is tailored to the specified browsers..

### 15. Read about Caret (^) and Tilda (~).
1. The caret (^) and tilde (~) symbols are used in package.json to specify the acceptable version ranges for dependencies. These symbols play a crucial role in managing dependency updates and ensuring compatibility within JavaScript projects.

2. Caret(^): The caret symbol (^) denotes that you want to allow both minor and patch version updates for a dependency. This means that if a new minor or patch version is released for the dependency, npm will automatically install it without requiring manual intervention. For instance, ^1.2.3 allows updates to versions like 1.3.0, 1.2.4, or 1.2.5 but not to major version 2.0.0.

3. Tilde(~): The tilde symbol (~) indicates that you only want to allow patch version updates for a dependency. This means that if a new patch version is released for the dependency, npm will automatically install it. However, minor or major version updates will require manual intervention. For example, ~1.2.3 allows updates to versions like 1.2.4 or 1.2.5 but not to minor version 1.3.0 or major version 2.0.0.

4. In general, using the caret symbol is a good choice for dependencies that are actively maintained and receive regular updates. It ensures that your project stays up-to-date with the latest bug fixes and security patches without introducing major breaking changes. However, if you need to maintain strict compatibility with a specific version and avoid unexpected changes, using the tilde symbol provides more control over dependency updates.

### 16. Read about Script types in HTML (MDN Docs)
1. In HTML, the script tag can be used to embed various types of scripts, including JavaScript, TypeScript, and ECMAScript Modules. 

2. The type attribute of the script tag specifies the type of script being embedded. Here's a summary of common script types:

    -   text/javascript: This is the default type for JavaScript scripts. It indicates that the script contains JavaScript code and should be interpreted by the browser's JavaScript engine.

    -   application/javascript: This is another valid type for JavaScript scripts. It's less commonly used but serves the same purpose as text/javascript.

    -   application/ecmascript: This type is used for ECMAScript Modules, a newer module format for JavaScript. It enables importing and exporting modules, facilitating code organization and reuse.

    -   application/x-typescript: This type is used for TypeScript scripts. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing. The browser doesn't interpret TypeScript directly; it needs to be compiled to JavaScript first.

    -   module: This type is an alias for application/javascript but is specifically used for ECMAScript Modules. It's more explicit in denoting the module format.

 3. In general, the default text/javascript type is sufficient for embedding JavaScript scripts. If you're using ECMAScript Modules, specify application/ecmascript or module to enable module support. For TypeScript scripts, use application/x-typescript to indicate the TypeScript code.
